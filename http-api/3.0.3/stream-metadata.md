Every stream in the Event Store has metadata associated with it. Internally, the metadata includes such information as the ACL of the stream and the maximum count and age for the events in the stream. Client code can also put information into stream metadata for use with projections or through the client API. 

A common use case of information you may want to store in metadata is information associated with an event that is not part of the event. An example of this might be which user wrote the event? Which application server were they talking to? From what IP address did the request come from? This type of information is not part of the actual event but is metadata assocatiated with the event.

Stream metadata is stored internally as JSON, and can be accessed over the HTTP APIs. 

## Reading Stream Metadata

To read the metadata, a `GET` request is issued to the attached metadata resource, which is currently of the form:

```
http://{eventstore}/streams/{stream-name}/metadata
```

However, you should not access metadata by constructing this URL yourself, as the right to change the resource address is reserved. Instead, you should follow the link for from the stream itself, which will enable your client to tolerate future changes to the addressing structure without breaking.

```
ouro@ouroboros:>curl -i http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/$users --user admin:changeit
```

...
```

Once you have the URI of the metadata stream, a `GET` request will retrieve the metadata:

```
ouro@ouroboros:> curl -i http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/$users/metadata --user admin:changeit
```

<span class="note">
Reading metadata may require that you pass credentials if you have security enabled, as in the examples above. If you do not pass credentials and they are required you will receive a 401 Unauthorized response.

## Writing Metadata

To update the metadata for a stream, a `POST` should be made to the metadata resource. This will replace the current metadata with the information posted.

### metadata.txt

```json
[
    {
        "eventId": "7c314750-05e1-439f-b2eb-f5b0e019be72",
        "eventType": "$user-updated",
        "data": {
            "readRole": "$all",
            "metaReadRole": "$all" 
        },
        "metadata": {
            "$causationid": "a9a03400-1107-11e5-b939-0800200c9a66",
            "$correlationid": "152c6630-1108-11e5-b939-0800200c9a66",
            "bodyClrTypeName": "MyApp.Events.UserUpdated, MyApp.Events, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"
        }
    }
]
```

User-specified metadata can also be added here. Some examples of good uses of user-specified metadata:

- which adapter is responsible for populating a stream
- which projection caused a stream to be created
- a correlation ID of some business process
- plenty more!

This information is then posted to the stream.

```
oruo@ouroboros:> curl -i -d @data.txt http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/$users/metadata --user admin:changeit -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset: utf-8
Location: http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/%24%24%24users/1
Server: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, GET, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-PINGOTHER
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Date: Sun, 16 Jun 2013 14:50:21 GMT

```

If the specified user does not have permissions to write to the stream metadata, a 401 Unauthorized response will be given:

```
ouro@ouroboros:> curl -i -d @data.txt http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/$users/metadata --user invaliduser:invalidpass -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```http

```
